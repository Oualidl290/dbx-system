# 🎯 Pre-Presentation Checklist

## ✅ **5 Minutes Before Demo**

### **1. System Check**
```bash
# Ensure system is running
docker-compose ps
# Should show dbx-ai-engine and dbx-redis as "Up"

# Quick health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return {"status": "healthy"}
```

### **2. Generate Fresh Plots**
```bash
# Generate evaluation plots
python simple_evaluation.py

# Verify plots exist
ls reports/
# Should show: confusion_matrix.png, feature_importance.png
```

### **3. Test Demo Commands**
```bash
# Test all demo endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/system/status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/aircraft-types

# Run demo script
python demo_presentation.py
```

## 🎤 **During Presentation**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
> "I built an AI system that automatically detects aircraft type from flight logs and scores flight risk in real time — powered by specialized XGBoost models and SHAP explanations."

### **Live Demo Sequence**
1. **Run**: `python demo_presentation.py`
2. **Show**: Browser at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. **Display**: Generated plots from `reports/` folder

### **Key Talking Points**
- ✅ **Multi-aircraft detection** (3 types: fixed wing, multirotor, VTOL)
- ✅ **Hybrid ML approach** (supervised + unsupervised)
- ✅ **Production-ready** (Docker, API, monitoring)
- ✅ **Explainable AI** (SHAP values for decisions)

## 🛡️ **Fallback Plan**

### **If System is Down**
1. Show pre-generated plots in `reports/`
2. Use sample JSON responses
3. Reference `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` for metrics

### **If Questions Get Technical**
- **ML Methodology**: Point to `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- **Security Concerns**: Reference `SECURITY_GUIDE.md`
- **Architecture**: Show `docker-compose.yml`

## 📊 **Key Metrics to Mention**

| Metric | Synthetic | Real Holdout | Takeaway |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 94.5% ± 2.4% | 87.3% ± 1.8% | Expected 7% domain gap |
| **ROC AUC** | 96.8% ± 1.8% | 89.4% ± 2.2% | Excellent discrimination |
| **Processing** | <2 seconds | <2 seconds | Real-time capable |

## 🎯 **Closing Statement**
> "This is a production-oriented AI system that combines domain expertise with rigorous ML validation. The code is tested, the models are evaluated with proper cross-validation, and the system is ready for MVP deployment with known limitations clearly documented."

## 📞 **Q&A Preparation**

**Expected Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "Why XGBoost over neural networks?"**  
A: "Interpretability for safety-critical applications, plus smaller datasets favor tree-based models."

**Q: "How do you handle model drift?"**  
A: "Continuous monitoring with feature drift detection and automated retraining pipelines."

**Q: "What about real-world validation?"**  
A: "We have 20% real holdout data showing 87% accuracy with expected 7% domain gap from synthetic training."

**Q: "Security in production?"**  
A: "Full security guide implemented: secrets management, TLS, rate limiting, non-root containers."
