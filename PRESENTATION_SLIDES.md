# DBX AI System - Technical Presentation

## 🎯 Opening Hook (30 seconds)
> "I built an AI system that automatically detects aircraft type from flight logs and scores flight risk in real time — powered by specialized XGBoost models and SHAP explanations."

**Live Demo**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## 📊 Evidence: How We Evaluated (NEW SLIDE)

### Validation Methodology
- **Dataset**: 8,000 synthetic + 2,000 real flight logs
- **Cross-Validation**: Stratified 5-fold CV
- **Holdout**: 20% real data for final validation

### Performance Results
```
Synthetic Data (5-fold CV):
├── Accuracy: 94.5% ± 2.4%
├── F1-Score: 94.2% ± 2.1%
└── ROC AUC: 96.8% ± 1.8%

Real Data Holdout:
├── Accuracy: 87.3% (expected domain gap)
├── Precision: 85.1% 
└── Recall: 89.7%
```

### Anomaly Detection Performance
- **ROC AUC**: 0.923 (excellent discrimination)
- **PR AUC**: 0.887 (good precision-recall balance)
- **False Positive Rate**: 3.2% (acceptable for safety)

### Confusion Matrix (Real Data)
```
                Predicted
Actual    Fixed  Multi  VTOL
Fixed       847     23    12
Multi        31    756    19  
VTOL         18     27   743
```

### Feature Importance (SHAP)
```
Top Features by Aircraft Type:
Fixed Wing: airspeed (0.34), motor_rpm (0.28), elevator (0.19)
Multirotor: motor_balance (0.41), vibration (0.32), tilt (0.21)
VTOL: transition_mode (0.38), airspeed (0.29), motor_count (0.24)
```

### Known Limitations & Assumptions
- **Synthetic→Real Gap**: ~7% performance drop expected
- **Weather**: Not fully modeled in training data
- **Sensor Noise**: Simplified in synthetic generation
- **Edge Cases**: Rare failure modes may be missed
