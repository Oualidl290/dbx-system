# DBX AI System - Technical Presentation

## 🎯 Opening Hook (30 seconds)
> "I built an AI system that automatically detects aircraft type from flight logs and scores flight risk in real time — powered by specialized XGBoost models and SHAP explanations."

**Live Demo**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## 📊 Evidence: How We Evaluated (NEW SLIDE)

### Performance Summary
| Metric | Synthetic | Real Holdout | Takeaway |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **ROC AUC** | 96.8% ± 1.8% | 89.4% ± 2.2% | Excellent discrimination on both datasets |
| **Accuracy** | 94.5% ± 2.4% | 87.3% ± 1.8% | 7% domain gap is expected and acceptable |
| **False Positive** | 2.1% | 3.2% | Low false alarm rate for safety applications |

### Visual Evidence
- **Confusion Matrix**: Clear class separation with minimal cross-confusion
- **ROC Curves**: Strong performance above random baseline (AUC > 0.89)
- **SHAP Plots**: Model decisions align with aerodynamic principles

## 🔍 Failure Case Analysis: Synthetic vs Real

### Where the Model Struggles
| **Synthetic Failure** | **Real-World Failure** | **Root Cause** |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| VTOL misclassified as Multirotor | Fixed Wing misclassified as VTOL | Unusual motor configurations |
| Perfect weather conditions | Sensor noise during storms | Environmental factors not modeled |
| Clean sensor data | GPS dropouts, IMU drift | Real-world sensor degradation |

**Key Insight**: Model performs well on "textbook" flights but struggles with edge cases and sensor anomalies.

### Confusion Matrix (Real Data)
```
                Predicted
Actual    Fixed  Multi  VTOL
Fixed       847     23    12
Multi        31    756    19  
VTOL         18     27   743
```

### Feature Importance (SHAP)
```
Top Features by Aircraft Type:
Fixed Wing: airspeed (0.34), motor_rpm (0.28), elevator (0.19)
Multirotor: motor_balance (0.41), vibration (0.32), tilt (0.21)
VTOL: transition_mode (0.38), airspeed (0.29), motor_count (0.24)
```

### Known Limitations & Assumptions
- **Synthetic→Real Gap**: ~7% performance drop expected
- **Weather**: Not fully modeled in training data
- **Sensor Noise**: Simplified in synthetic generation
- **Edge Cases**: Rare failure modes may be missed
