5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5: File Processing and Format Support

**User Story:** As a pilot or flight operator, I want to upload various flight log formats so that I can analyze data from different aircraft systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload CSV files THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the data with proper error handling
2. WHEN I upload MAVLink binary logs THEN the system SHALL extract telemetry data and convert to analysis format
3. WHEN I upload ULog files THEN the system SHALL process PX4 format data correctly
4. WHEN file processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested corrections
5. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently with progress tracking

### Requirement 6: Real-time Features and WebSocket Support

**User Story:** As a flight operations manager, I want real-time updates and notifications so that I can monitor ongoing analyses and system status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyses complete THEN the system SHALL send WebSocket notifications to connected clients
2. WHEN system alerts occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast notifications with appropriate priority levels
3. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL manage WebSocket connections efficiently
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection automatically
5. WHEN real-time data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide live system metrics and status updates

### Requirement 7: Advanced Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As an aviation safety manager, I want comprehensive reporting and analytics so that I can generate insights and compliance reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request analysis reports THEN the system SHALL generate PDF documents with charts and recommendations
2. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV/Excel formats with customizable field selection
3. WHEN I compare analyses THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison with statistical analysis
4. WHEN I request trend analysis THEN the system SHALL provide historical patterns and predictive insights
5. WHEN I generate compliance reports THEN the system SHALL include required aviation safety metrics and certifications

### Requirement 8: System Administration and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and administration tools so that I can maintain system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check system status THEN the system SHALL provide detailed health metrics for all components
