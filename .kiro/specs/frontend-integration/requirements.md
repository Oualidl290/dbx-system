3. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show current system status, active analyses, and recent alerts
4. WHEN multiple users are online THEN the system SHALL show collaborative indicators and shared analysis status
5. WHEN system issues occur THEN the system SHALL display health status for database, AI models, and processing queue

### Requirement 4: Aircraft Registry and Fleet Management

**User Story:** As a fleet manager, I need to manage aircraft information and track analysis history per aircraft so that I can maintain safety records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I register aircraft THEN the system SHALL capture aircraft type, registration number, manufacturer, model, and specifications
2. WHEN I view aircraft details THEN the system SHALL show complete analysis history, maintenance recommendations, and risk trends
3. WHEN I manage multiple aircraft THEN the system SHALL provide fleet overview with status indicators and comparative analytics
4. WHEN I update aircraft information THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails and version history
5. WHEN I decommission aircraft THEN the system SHALL archive data while maintaining historical analysis records

### Requirement 5: Advanced Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a safety manager, I need comprehensive reports and analytics so that I can demonstrate compliance and identify trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate reports THEN the system SHALL create PDF documents with charts, analysis summaries, and recommendations
2. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV/Excel formats with customizable field selection and date ranges
3. WHEN I compare analyses THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side comparisons with statistical significance testing
4. WHEN I analyze trends THEN the system SHALL provide time-series charts showing risk patterns and performance metrics
5. WHEN I need compliance reports THEN the system SHALL generate standardized aviation safety reports with required metrics

### Requirement 6: System Administration Interface

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I need administrative tools so that I can manage users, monitor performance, and maintain system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I manage users THEN the system SHALL provide user creation, role assignment, and access control with organization boundaries
2. WHEN I monitor system performance THEN the system SHALL display API response times, database performance, and resource usage
3. WHEN I configure system settings THEN the system SHALL provide secure configuration management with validation
4. WHEN I review audit logs THEN the system SHALL show user activities, security events, and system changes
5. WHEN I manage API keys THEN the system SHALL provide key generation, scope management, and usage analytics

### Requirement 7: Mobile-Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a field inspector, I need mobile access to the system so that I can review analyses and upload data from remote locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the system on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL adapt to screen sizes with touch-friendly controls
2. WHEN I upload files on mobile THEN the system SHALL support camera capture and file selection from device storage
3. WHEN I view analyses on mobile THEN the system SHALL present data in mobile-optimized layouts with swipe navigation
4. WHEN I receive alerts on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide push notifications and offline alert queuing
5. WHEN connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide offline capabilities and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 8: Data Visualization and Charts

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I need interactive visualizations so that I can understand flight patterns and identify safety trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view flight data THEN the system SHALL display interactive time-series charts for altitude, speed, battery, and other parameters
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight anomalous data points on charts with explanatory tooltips
3. WHEN I analyze aircraft performance THEN the system SHALL provide aircraft-specific visualizations (motor RPM for multirotors, airspeed for fixed-wing)
4. WHEN I compare flights THEN the system SHALL overlay multiple flight paths and parameter charts for comparison
5. WHEN I export visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide high-resolution chart exports for reports and presentations

### Requirement 9: Integration and API Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I need API integration tools so that I can connect the aviation system with other operational systems.
